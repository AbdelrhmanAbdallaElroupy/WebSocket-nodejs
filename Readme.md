### This project demonstrates WebSocket functionality. It includes three main files:

1.server.js: This file handles the backend part of the application, likely establishing WebSocket connections and managing data transmission between clients and the server.

2.index.html: This HTML file represents the frontend part of the application. It likely contains the structure of the webpage and might include JavaScript code to interact with the WebSocket server.

3.index.js: This JavaScript file is part of the frontend and likely contains client-side code to interact with the WebSocket server, handling events and updating the UI based on data received from the server.

### To run the project:

1.Run npm i to install the necessary dependencies.

2.Execute node server.js to start the server.

3.Access the application through the link http://127.0.0.1:5500/app/index.html from two different tabs or browsers.

4.You should observe real-time mouse movement synchronization between the two tabs, demonstrating WebSocket functionality where data is transmitted instantly between clients and the server.
